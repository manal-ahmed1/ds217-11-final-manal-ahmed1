Missing data handling method: used forward fill to impute all missing values.

Air Temperature, Wet Bulb Temperature, Rain Intensity, Total Rain, Precipitation Type, Barometric Pressure, and Heading had missing data

All but Air Temperature and Barometric Pressure had 75935 values that needed to be filled. Air Temperature had 75, and Barometric Pressure had 146.

The outlier detection method used was IQR, and any values that were considered outliers were capped.

Columns and number of outliers before cleaning: {'Air Temperature': np.int64(97), 'Wet Bulb Temperature': np.int64(279), 'Humidity': np.int64(185), 'Rain Intensity': np.int64(6641), 'Interval Rain': np.int64(15884), 'Total Rain': np.int64(11622), 'Precipitation Type': np.int64(12706), 'Wind Direction': np.int64(0), 'Wind Speed': np.int64(12229), 'Maximum Wind Speed': np.int64(4024), 'Barometric Pressure': np.int64(4639), 'Solar Radiation': np.int64(29631), 'Heading': np.int64(27532), 'Battery Life': np.int64(6)}
