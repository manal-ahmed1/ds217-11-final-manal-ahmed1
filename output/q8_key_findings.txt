Key Findings Summary

MODEL PERFORMANCE:
- Best performing model: Random Forest model (testing R² = 0.82)
- The linear regression did quite poorly (testing R² = 0.18)

FEATURE IMPORTANCE (Random Forest):
- Most important feature: Temperature Difference (importance: 0.46)
- Top 3 features are Temperature Difference, Wet Bulb Temperature, and Battery Life
- Year seems to be the most important in the temporal features

TEMPORAL PATTERNS:
- There seems to be seasonal patterns when humidity is concerned, as it periodically goes up and down as the time passes.

DATA QUALITY:
- Rows cleaned: 196289. Same number of rows as before, since NAs weren't dropped but imputed through forward-fill
- Outliers were capped using the IQR method
